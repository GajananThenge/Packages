NN?

ANN is a machine Learning Technique which mimics functinality of human brain.

Building blocks of human brain known as neuron. Typycally a human brain consis of 10 11 neurons.

These neurons are interconnected to each other in a hiearchical fashion via Axons and trasmits Electrical signal from one layer to another call synapses. 

This is how human learn things. Whenever we see, hear,feel and think something a 
synapse(electrical impulse) is fired from one neuron to another in the hierarchy 
which enables us to learn ,remember and memorize things in our daily life since the 
day we were born.



Why NN?


Structure and working of a nueron
Similar to brain "Artifician Neuron" or "neuron" is bused as Building block of ANN of NN.

whre x1,x2,...,xn are inputs to neuron
w1,w2,...,wn are weights associated with neuron. In biological neuron weights represents e biological synaptic strengths
A : represents Activation function here.It will be responsible to activate or deactivate neuron.


Bias Node

Using “bias” node is usually critical for creating successful learning model. 
In short, a bias value allows to shift the activation function to the left or 
right and it helps getting better fit for the data (better prediction function 
as output).


Typical NN/ANN is interconnected network of neuron which consists of:
	1. Input Layer
	2. Hidden Layer
	3. Output Layer
